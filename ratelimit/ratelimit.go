// Package ratelimit defines the rate-limiting abstraction for the lulu
// framework.
//
// It provides a minimal, algorithm-agnostic interface for rate limiting.
// Concrete implementations (token bucket, BBR, Sentinel, etc.) implement this
// interface so that business code depends only on the contract.

// has been exceeded.
var ErrLimited = errors.New("ratelimit: rate limit exceeded")

// Limiter is the core rate-limiting contract.

// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use.

	// ok is false (with ErrLimited) if the rate limit has been exceeded.

	// It returns ErrLimited only if the limiter is permanently exhausted
	// (e.g. a zero-rate limiter); otherwise it blocks until tokens are
	// available.
